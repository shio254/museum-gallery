                    <h3>Still Figuring It Out</h3>
                    <p>This blog is a quiet corner of my life.</p>

                    <p>I’m a student, a gym regular, and someone constantly juggling discipline with distraction. I care about growth, both physical and mental, but I don’t pretend to have it all figured out. Some days I’m focused and driven. Other days I feel lost, scrolling past time I won’t get back.</p>

                    <p>This space exists to slow things down. To put thoughts into words instead of letting them pile up in my head. It’s not polished, and it’s not meant to be. It's real, and it’s evolving, just like me.</p>

        <section id="stories"><h2>Stories</h2>
            <article>
                    <h3>Some entries will be short. Some will ramble.</h3>
                    <p>I’ll write about routines that worked until they didn’t. About the gym, missed alarms, late-night overthinking, motivation that fades, and the rare days where everything clicks. There might be reflections on love, distance, ambition, and the pressure of becoming something more than yesterday.</p>
                    <p>These aren’t success stories. They’re progress stories. Unfinished, imperfect, and honest.</p>

                    <p>If something here feels familiar, maybe that’s the point.</p>
