                <p>I’m in that phase where nothing feels fully sorted, but everything feels important. Studies, fitness, creativity, ambition, self-doubt, discipline, distractions, all of it running in parallel. Some days I’m locked in. Other days I spiral and lose hours to a screen, knowing exactly what I should be doing and still not doing it.</p>
                <p>I’m trying to build consistency without killing curiosity. Trying to grow without pretending I’ve already arrived.</p>

                <p>This space isn't here to impress anyone. It’s here to document progress, setbacks, lessons, and the quiet moments in between. Maybe I’ll write about training, maybe about tech, maybe about love, motivation, failure, or nothing in particular. Depends on the day.</p>

                <p>If you’re reading this and you’re also figuring things out, you’re not behind. You’re just in motion.</p>
                <p>This is temporary. So am I. But growth isn’t.</p><br>
