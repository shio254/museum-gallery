                <p>This is a temporary blog, nothing polished, nothing planned. Just a small space to hold a moment that stayed with me longer than I expected. I saw an elephant. Not in a zoo or behind fences, but out there, alive, calm, and completely uninterested in my existence. This blog is about that feeling.</p>

                <p>It happened without warning. One second the road was empty, the next there it was, massive, quiet, and moving with a kind of confidence you don’t see often. No rush. No fear. Just presence.</p>
                <p>I remember standing still, not because I was told to, but because my body understood before my mind did. The elephant didn’t look at me like a threat or a guest. I was just another object in its world, temporary and irrelevant.</p>
                <p>What struck me most was the silence. For something so large, it carried itself gently. Each step felt deliberate, like it knew exactly where it belonged. When it walked past and disappeared into the trees, the space felt louder than before.</p>
                <p>I didn’t take much from that moment except this, some things don’t need meaning. They just need to be witnessed.</p>
